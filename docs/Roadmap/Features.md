    - Built-in support for shadow DOM and web components.
        
3. **Enhanced Selectors**:
    
    - Extend CSS selectors with custom pseudo-selectors (e.g., `:visible`, `:in-viewport`).
        
    - Support for XPath or other advanced querying methods.
        
4. **Reactive Data Binding**:
    
    - Two-way data binding for form elements and DOM updates.
        
    - Integrate with state management for reactive UI updates.
        
5. **Animation and Transitions**:
    
    - Built-in support for CSS animations and transitions.
        
    - Advanced animation sequencing and chaining.

### **Async and Network Operations**

6. **Improved AJAX and Fetch API**:
    
    - Simplify `fetch` with a jQuery-like API (e.g., `.ajax()`, `.get()`, `.post()`).
        
    - Built-in support for retries, timeouts, and aborting requests.
        
7. **WebSocket Integration**:
    
    - Provide a simple API for WebSocket connections and message handling.
        
8. **Promises and Async/Await Support**:
    
    - Ensure all async operations return Promises for better chaining and error handling.

### **Storage and State Management**

9. **Unified Storage API**:
    
    - Simplify `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `IndexedDB` with a consistent API.
        
    - Add support for expiration, encryption, and data versioning.
        
10. **State Management**:
    
    - Lightweight state management for single-page applications (SPA).
        
    - Reactive state updates with DOM bindings.

### **Component-Based Development**

11. **Component System**:
    
    - A simple way to define and reuse UI components.
        
    - Lifecycle hooks (e.g., `mount`, `unmount`, `update`).
        
12. **Templating Engine**:
    
    - Built-in support for HTML templating (e.g., Mustache-like syntax or JSX-like syntax).

### **Performance and Optimization**

13. **Lazy Loading**:
    
    - Support for lazy-loading images, scripts, and components.
        
14. **Debouncing and Throttling**:
    
    - Built-in utilities for optimizing event handlers (e.g., scroll, resize).
        
15. **Virtual DOM**:
    
    - Optional virtual DOM for efficient updates in complex UIs.
