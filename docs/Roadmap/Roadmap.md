# QuokkaJS Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for the development of **QuokkaJS**, a modern, feature-rich library inspired by jQuery, built with TypeScript. The goal is to create a robust, modular, and developer-friendly library for DOM manipulation, storage access, async utilities, and more.

---

## **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**
**Goal**: Define the project scope, set up the development environment, and create a basic structure.

### Milestones
- [x] Define the project vision and goals.
- [x] Choose the project name: **QuokkaJS**.
- [x] Set up the repository on GitHub.
- [ ] Create a `Roadmap.md` file to outline the project plan.
- [ ] Set up the development environment:
  - Initialize the project with `npm init`.
  - Configure TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`).
  - Set up a bundler (e.g., Rollup or Vite) for building the library.
  - Add linting and formatting tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
- [x] Create a basic project structure:

## **Phase 2: Core Module Development**
**Goal**: Implement the core functionality of QuokkaJS, starting with DOM manipulation.

### Milestones
- [ ] Implement the `DOM` module:
- [ ] Add support for selecting elements (`select`, `selectAll`).
- [ ] Add event handling (`on`, `off`).
- [ ] Add DOM manipulation methods (`css`, `addClass`, `removeClass`, `html`, `text`).
- [ ] Add chaining support for fluent API.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the `DOM` module.
- [ ] Document the `DOM` module in `/docs`.

---

## **Phase 3: Additional Modules**
**Goal**: Expand QuokkaJS with additional modules for storage, async utilities, and more.

### Milestones
- [ ] Implement the `Storage` module:
- [ ] Add support for `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
- [ ] Add methods for `set`, `get`, `remove`, and `clear`.
- [ ] Implement the `Async` module:
- [ ] Add a wrapper for `fetch` with error handling.
- [ ] Add utilities for `Promise`-based operations.
- [ ] Implement the `Animation` module:
- [ ] Add basic animation utilities (e.g., `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `slideUp`, `slideDown`).
- [ ] Write unit tests for each module.
- [ ] Document each module in `/docs`.

---

## **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
**Goal**: Add advanced features to make QuokkaJS more powerful and versatile.

### Milestones
- [ ] Add plugin support:
- [ ] Create a plugin system for extending QuokkaJS.
- [ ] Write documentation for creating and using plugins.
- [ ] Add utility functions:
- [ ] Add helpers for common tasks (e.g., `debounce`, `throttle`).
- [ ] Add TypeScript-specific features:
- [ ] Improve type inference and autocompletion.
- [ ] Add generics for better type safety.
- [ ] Write unit tests for advanced features.
- [ ] Document advanced features in `/docs`.

---

## **Phase 5: Optimization and Performance**
**Goal**: Optimize QuokkaJS for performance and bundle size.

### Milestones
- [ ] Optimize the code for performance:
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary DOM operations.
- [ ] Use efficient algorithms for common tasks.
- [ ] Minimize the bundle size:
- [ ] Enable tree shaking in the bundler.
- [ ] Split the library into smaller chunks (e.g., `quokka-dom`, `quokka-storage`).
- [ ] Add support for lazy loading modules.
- [ ] Write performance benchmarks.

---

## **Phase 6: Testing and Debugging**
**Goal**: Ensure QuokkaJS is stable, reliable, and bug-free.

### Milestones
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all modules.
- [ ] Set up end-to-end (E2E) testing for browser compatibility.
- [ ] Test QuokkaJS in real-world projects:
- [ ] Create example projects to demonstrate usage.
- [ ] Test in different environments (e.g., Node.js, browsers).
- [ ] Fix bugs and improve error handling.

---

## **Phase 7: Documentation and Examples**
**Goal**: Provide clear, comprehensive documentation and examples for users.

### Milestones
- [ ] Write a detailed `README.md`:
- [ ] Add installation instructions.
- [ ] Add usage examples for each module.
- [ ] Add API documentation.
- [ ] Create a documentation website:
- [ ] Use a tool like [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) or [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
- [ ] Host the documentation on GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- [ ] Add code examples and tutorials:
- [ ] Create a `/examples` folder with sample projects.
- [ ] Write tutorials for common use cases.

---

## **Phase 8: Publishing and Community Building**
**Goal**: Publish QuokkaJS to npm and build a community around the project.

### Milestones
- [ ] Publish QuokkaJS to npm:
- [ ] Create an npm account (if not already done).
- [ ] Publish the package: `npm publish`.
- [ ] Promote the library:
- [ ] Share on social media and developer forums.
- [ ] Write a blog post introducing QuokkaJS.
- [ ] Gather feedback from users:
- [ ] Create a GitHub Discussions board for questions and feedback.
- [ ] Encourage users to open issues and suggest features.
- [ ] Plan future updates based on user feedback.

---

## **Phase 9: Maintenance and Future Development**
**Goal**: Maintain QuokkaJS and add new features based on user needs.

### Milestones
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies.
- [ ] Fix bugs and address issues reported by users.
- [ ] Add new features based on community feedback.
- [ ] Expand the plugin ecosystem.
- [ ] Improve performance and bundle size over time.
