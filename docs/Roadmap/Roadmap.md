# QuokkaJS Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for the development of **QuokkaJS**, a modern, feature-rich library inspired by jQuery, built with TypeScript. The goal is to create a robust, modular, and developer-friendly library for DOM manipulation, storage access, async utilities, and more.

---

## **Project Overview**
QuokkaJS aims to combine jQuery's simplicity with modern web development practices. It will provide a lightweight yet powerful solution for building feature-rich web applications, with a focus on TypeScript support, modern DOM APIs, and developer experience.

---

## **Core Features**
The following features will be implemented to build on jQuery's strengths and introduce modern capabilities:

### **Core Features (Building on jQuery's Strengths)**
1. **TypeScript-First Design**:
   - Strong typing for DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests.
   - Type-safe selectors and chaining methods.
2. **Modern DOM Manipulation**:
   - Support for modern DOM APIs like `MutationObserver` for reactive DOM updates.
   - Built-in support for shadow DOM and web components.
3. **Enhanced Selectors**:
   - Extend CSS selectors with custom pseudo-selectors (e.g., `:visible`, `:in-viewport`).
   - Support for XPath or other advanced querying methods.
4. **Reactive Data Binding**:
   - Two-way data binding for form elements and DOM updates.
   - Integration with state management for reactive UI updates.
5. **Animation and Transitions**:
   - Built-in support for CSS animations and transitions.
   - Advanced animation sequencing and chaining.

### **Async and Network Operations**
6. **Improved AJAX and Fetch API**:
   - Simplify `fetch` with a jQuery-like API (e.g., `.ajax()`, `.get()`, `.post()`).
   - Built-in support for retries, timeouts, and aborting requests.
7. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Simple API for WebSocket connections and message handling.
8. **Promises and Async/Await Support**:
   - Ensure all async operations return Promises for better chaining and error handling.

### **Storage and State Management**
9. **Unified Storage API**:
   - Simplify `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `IndexedDB` with a consistent API.
   - Add support for expiration, encryption, and data versioning.
10. **State Management**:
    - Lightweight state management for single-page applications (SPA).
    - Reactive state updates with DOM bindings.

### **Component-Based Development**
11. **Component System**:
    - Simple way to define and reuse UI components.
    - Lifecycle hooks (e.g., `mount`, `unmount`, `update`).
12. **Templating Engine**:
    - Built-in support for HTML templating (e.g., Mustache-like syntax or JSX-like syntax).

### **Performance and Optimization**
13. **Lazy Loading**:
    - TypeScript support for plugin development.
    - Support for lazy-loading images, scripts, and components.
14. **Debouncing and Throttling**:
    - Built-in utilities for optimizing event handlers (e.g., scroll, resize).
15. **Virtual DOM**:
    - Optional virtual DOM for efficient updates in complex UIs.

### **Developer Experience**
16. **Debugging Tools**:
    - Built-in debugging utilities (e.g., logging, performance profiling).
    - Visual DOM inspection tools.
17. **Plugin System**:
    - Robust plugin architecture for extending the library.
18. **Error Handling**:
    - Graceful error handling for DOM operations and network requests.
    - Custom error types and logging.

### **Cross-Browser and Modern Web Features**
19. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
    - Ensure compatibility with modern browsers while providing polyfills for older ones.
20. **Responsive Design Helpers**:
    - Utilities for working with media queries and responsive breakpoints.
21. **Accessibility (a11y) Support**:
    - Built-in tools for improving accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes, focus management).

### **Miscellaneous Features**
22. **Form Handling (?)**:
    - Simplify form validation, serialization, and submission.
23. **Routing (?)**:
    - Lightweight client-side routing for SPAs.
24. **Internationalization (i18n) (?)**:
    - Built-in support for multi-language applications.
25. **Utility Functions (?)**:
    - Rich set of utility functions (e.g., deep cloning, object merging, array manipulation).

### **Distinctive Features**
26. **Reactive Programming (?)**:
    - Integrate with reactive programming paradigms (e.g., RxJS-like observables).
27. **AI/ML Integration (?)**:
    - Provide hooks for integrating with AI/ML models (e.g., image recognition, natural language processing).
28. **Offline-First Support (?)**:
    - Built-in tools for building offline-first applications (e.g., service workers, caching).
29. **Progressive Web App (PWA) Features (?)**:
    - Simplify PWA development with built-in support for service workers, caching, and push notifications.
