# **QuokkaJS**Â ðŸ¦˜

**QuokkaJS**Â is aÂ **work-in-progress**, modern, feature-rich library inspired byÂ **jQuery**, built withÂ **TypeScript**. The goal is to create a robust, modular, and developer-friendly library for DOM manipulation, storage access, async utilities, and more, while leveraging the power of TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features.

---

## **Vision**

The goal of QuokkaJS is to provide aÂ **lightweight**,Â **modular**, andÂ **type-safe**Â alternative to jQuery for modern web development. It will offer a fluent API for DOM manipulation, utilities for working with storage and async operations, and a plugin system for extensibility.

---

## **Planned Features**

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™re planning to build:

### **Core Features**

- **DOM Manipulation**: Select and manipulate DOM elements with a chainable API.

- **Event Handling**: Easily attach and detach event listeners.

- **Storage Utilities**: Simplify access toÂ `localStorage`Â andÂ `sessionStorage`.

- **Async Utilities**: Handle asynchronous operations with built-in helpers.


### **Advanced Features**

- **Animation Utilities**: Add support for basic animations (e.g., fade, slide).

- **Plugin System**: Allow developers to extend QuokkaJS with custom plugins.

- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed for better developer experience and type safety.


---

## **Why QuokkaJS?**

- **Modern**: Built with TypeScript and modern JavaScript features.

- **Modular**: Import only the modules you need to keep your bundle size small.

- **Type-Safe**: Leverage TypeScriptâ€™s type system to catch errors early.

- **Extensible**: Add custom functionality through plugins.
